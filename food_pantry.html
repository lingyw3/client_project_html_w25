        <p>Students experiencing food insecurity are more likely to struggle academically, miss classes, and experience stress. The Maize & Blue Cupboard ensures that every student has access to the basic nutrition needed to succeed. This support plays a critical role in students’ health, well-being, and academic persistence.</p>
